# CDC-Manuals
Scanned, OCRed, CDC Manuals with full bookmarks added, thus making them actually usable.

Huge thanks go to the contributers to the archives from which these manuals came, they did the grunt work of scanning them in the first place.  Some of the names are obvious, bitsavers, Tom Hunter, and a cast of millions...Please keep the scans coming, many are missing.
