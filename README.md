# CDC-Manuals
Scanned, OCRed, CDC Manuals with full bookmarks added, thus making them actually usable.

My wife just called them "Jim's Built-in Instants"...  Hmm...  "Jim's Instants" is kinda descriptive of the anal detail....

Huge thanks go to the contributers to the archives from which these manuals came, they did the grunt work of scanning them in the first place.  Some of the names are obvious, bitsavers, Tom Hunter, and a cast of millions...Please keep the scans coming, many are missing.  I do not take credit for the scans (unless otherwise specified), just the OCR and full bookmarks.
